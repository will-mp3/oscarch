/*
 * A class represents an object or entity from the domain of the program. For example, classes in the banking domain are:
 * Account, Transaction, User, etc.
 *
 * A class has internal data (attributes, field, or just variables) and operations that work on that data (methods or functions).
 *
 * A class can have multiple instances, each one with its own data (with its own state).
 *
 * This is the abstract class Animal (this is the class declaration, the class implementation is found in Animal.cpp).
 * An abstract class represents an abstract concept that cannot be instantiated directly, but by using its subclasses.
 * Abstract class are those that have one or more virtual methods, e.g.:
 *                        virtual void eat(string &food) = 0;
